due to the early nature of the Onuo Market file, i have to add the requirement for IndEvo for the mod.

you can remove the indevo section in data>campaign>econ>diableavionics_outerTerminus.json File.
aka remove that ["IndEvo_dryDock", "gamma_core"],

and then from the mod-info.json remove that 

        {
            "id": "IndEvo",
            "name": "Industrial.Evolution",
            #"version": "2.7.6"
        },

then you'll be able to run the mod without industrial evolution.
