diable_miniGust_cer,SHIP,"While ostensibly related to the regular Gust-class hull design, it is unclear whether this model was a small scale prototype that turned out too performant to be put aside or rather was a successful miniaturization attempt. In any case the Pocket-Gust translates what made its bigger brother good as a light cruiser into an even nimbler Destroyer frame. 

This ship has been Restored from a Destroyed Ship to Near Standard Spec but was unable to restore the Remote control due to the lack of Specialized Parts, so instead they added a Plasma Jets system to it.",,,
diable_gust_cer,SHIP,"A mainstay of Diable Avionics, these light cruisers are fast and excel in providing field support to the Wanzer element they carry. Their primary battery consists of a front-facing heavy weapon emplacement which gives them an unexpected punch but the relative lack of secondary weapons limits their effectiveness against multiple threats.

The Gust cruiser design dates back almost 150 years before the collapse, during the peak of Diable Avionics's growth when their military contracts abounded and they could afford the R&D cost for less conventional designs. Historical notes and logs from the oldest ships of this class occasionally describe the difficulty of incorporating the proprietary ""Overlord"" system, and all the interferences to the local electromagnetic environment it causes, in a relatively small hull with its sensitive comm/data sphere. 

This device allows elite pilots well protected within the confine of the cruiser hull to remotely take over the controls of any fighter hosted by the Gust. The need for an open interface controls, the cost of the Tachyon comm-links and the limited time such connection can be upheld still prevent the massive use of remote-controlled Wanzers. 

Nonetheless, that system provides a potent tool that can be used in a pinch to deliver a decisive blow. While initially welcomed by regular pilots that saw their odds of surviving increase as well as being able to learn directly from the bests, these systems have since taken a grim reputation as they can also be used to ensure a mission get carried out at any cost.

This ship has been Restored from a Destroyed Ship to Near Standard Spec but was unable to restore the Remote control due to the lack of Specialized Parts, so instead they added Plasma Burn system to it.",,,
diable_versant_cer,SHIP,"One of the very last pre-Collapse designs the local branch of the Diable Avionics Corporation got its hands on before being abruptly cut-off. It features a mobile frame that can manipulate its shape to increase raw speed, or maneuverability. Advanced integrated weaponry and the latest version of the Diable Avionics's Quantum Targeting Prediction software(TM) come pre-installed.

This Mass Production version has a Phase Core Stable Enough for Minor Stats Boost.",,,

Junker’s Guild Restored those ships and Improved them with Insulated Engine assembly and an IBIS Pointed Backwards to give them more survivability on the field.",,,
diable_fractus_cer,SHIP,"Taking after the ubiquitous Condor, this ship is a conversion of the Chinook tanker hull, modified to house a double flight deck. The central fuel tank has been traded for a medium-sized hard-point, useful for supporting the ship's strike-craft complement with stand-off artillery fire.

This Carrier now has Specialized Gantries for The Arbitrator series thanks to Corvid Engineering & Recovery Subsidary.",,,
diable_rime_m_cer,SHIP,"A light cruiser getting progressively phased out due to midling combat performance. While still adequate as a back-lines support ship, the fragility of the hull as well as its lack of dedicated Wanzer facilities has lead the Admiralty to decide to convert existing Rime-class into armed merchants instead.

Junker's Guild Restored those Ships and Modified them with their Favorite System, Plasma Jets.",,,

#Corvid C types,,,,,
diable_eagle_C,SHIP,"The Type-11 Raven is the heaviest 9th generation strike-craft Wanzers in the Diable Avionics catalog, thus the heaviest currently produced period. Being a good 50% larger than 7th gen frames, it can accommodate nearly full-size ship weaponry: a Grave HMG and a compact Glowtusk make those assault Wanzers quite effective against anything but the thickest defense. A compact Grazer Core and huge plates of ablative nano-armor complete the deadly package. 

While designed as a triple-seater craft to help spread the workload, the Raven can still be maned single-handedly by a 9th gen Wanzer pilot thanks to the S-type neural interface. Even with the extra volume and mass of this design, engineers were unable to incorporate both a TX-5 class shield emitter alongside a displacement system, the latter being ultimately kept to prevent outmaneuvering by enemy fighter forces. Mass production of such an advanced craft is not practical and thus comes with an eyebrow-raising price tag.",,,

Mass production of such an advanced craft is not practical and thus comes with an eyebrow-raising price tag.",,,
diable_valiant_C,SHIP,"The (current) pinnacle of strike-craft Wanzer technology, the Valiant received its ""Versatile"" designation from the ability to reconfigure its thruster profile for maximum velocity or maneuverability. This makes them the fastest Wanzers on the battlefield, alleviating the key weakness of the other models. In addition to speed, Valiant Wanzers are also equipped with a shield, a pair of Micro-Missile launchers, a PD turret and a pair of deadly miniaturized electromagnetic rifles. This well-rounded load-out allows them to effectively engage any target. Unsurprisingly, they come with a price tag matching their impressive performance.

Although the use of transforming Wanzers remains unreliable, their performance is not to be understated. The Valiant is a 9th+ generation Wanzer, incorporating expensive miniaturized TX-5 omni-shield technology and advanced energy weapons. Additionally, this Wanzer was designed to be able to reconfigure its hull components and internal machinery to maximize energy flow to its engines when required.

Due to the multiple control modes needed to operate the Valiant, most pilots get a surgically implanted neural-link interface called the S-Type device, which maps out neuron activity patterns for control inputs. Out of ten trained pilots fitted with the S-Type device, seven will show no side effects, two will have moderate to severe memory loss when disconnected from their Wanzer, and the remainder are afflicted with multiple personality disorders, psychosis or in rare instances, brain death. Those who do not survive the procedure are posthumously awarded two ranks.

While far from being the most powerful Wanzer individually, they certainly are such when measured by weight.",,,
diable_zephyr_C,SHIP,"An early 9th gen model of Wanzer that later lead to both the Valiant-class and the Raven-class Wanzers. For the former, it demonstrated the validity of the concept of multiple energy configurations via physical component reconfiguration, aka Versatile Frame Design. For the latter, it proved that larger models of Wanzers were able to stand toe to toe with frigates and survive such encounter while still being serviceable by a modified Wanzer gantry (those now being the standard on all Diable Avionics ship models with Wanzer carrying capacity). 

Despite having been designed to use traditional controls, this Wanzer also served as a test-bed for the vastly more efficient S-Type Neural Interface. Today's modernized retrofits are now using those by default and will only accept manual inputs after some minor cockpit modifications. Given the constant shortage of well trained S-type pilots, about 67% of the Zephyrs undergo the procedure immediately after exiting the production line, a fact often pointed out as a waste of resources by the administration.",,,

diable_srabbuiltin,WEAPON,"The SRAB guided charge is a re-engineering of a mining device. While its civilian version was ill-suited to combat use, the massive amount of xenon tetroxide contained in the militarized homing impactor nows lends a credible threat to any target. 

Directly shaped in its low-temperature crystalline form, the projectile is uncommon in that the detonating compound itself is used as the structural body, without any outer skin of any kind. All electronic components are fixed on top of the explosive. Steering is achieved by local ablation of the outer layer of xenon tetroxide using a low power laser, and the detonation is initiated by a simple contact fuse. The explosion from such a device liberates large quantities of pure oxygen, usually triggering many electronic safeties in the target to prevent secondary fire. 
 
However the lack of protective skin on the projectile means that a few well-placed shots have the potential of causing an early detonation.

diable_microreioi,WEAPON,"Built into the flank of the Pocket-Gust-class, this six tubes wide Micro-Missile Array supplements its main armaments with a flurry of Diable Avionic's signature ordinance, bringing havoc and confusion in the enemy's point-defense grid and chipping away armor at a steady rate.

These simple missiles rely on randomized target interception algorithms to confuse enemy point defenses: they assist the fleet's Wanzer wings in accomplishing their mission while being exposed to minimal return fire and they cover the approach of more dangerous ordnances. Furthermore they subtly enhance the fleet in every aspect, forcing the enemy to constantly keep their shield up at all times, limiting their maneuverability. While using a few of them might be considered a waste of resources, their strength rises sharply with numbers, and their virtually unlimited stock means they are a constant drain on the enemy for the whole battle duration.

diable_LowState,WEAPON,"A Spinal Version of the Diurne State Beam array being a cheaper Version of the State Support Beam with Longer Range thanks to the Bigger Structure of the Weapon.

The ""State"" positron emitter system is a specialized particle beam connected to the host vessel's reactors to power the relatively inefficient matter/antimatter creation process. The choice of positrons limit range due to self repulsion, but that same property makes them much easier to manipulate into a weaponized beam.

A segment of the Diable Avionics military particularly proud of the technological achievements of their weapon division has for a long time criticized the State for being ""too mundane"". They would deliberately eschew what is in essence a bland but effective device in favor of something unusual but less potent, claiming that esoteric weapons have the added benefit of a deep psychological impact upon the enemy crews. While studies did acknowledge some veracity to these claims, it is unclear if the trade-off is strategically favorable.",Pressure,,
